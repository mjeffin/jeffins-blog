## Securing connections via SSL

This [post](https://loganmarchione.com/2020/10/securing-postgres-connections-using-lets-encrypt-certificates/) gives detailed instructions on how to enable
SSL for postgres using Letencrypt certificates for internet facing databases. The post is written for postgres 11, so if you are using a different version, make sure 
to update 11 in the postgres path to your version. It works like a charm and thank you [ Logan Marchione,](https://loganmarchione.com/) üôè

## Find disk space used by a database
It's important to keep track of the disk space used by a db to ensure that you don't run out of disk space. Here's the command to get the size for a single database.

```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty( pg_database_size(‚Äò<db-name>‚Äô) );
```
