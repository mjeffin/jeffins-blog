This is the new home for my blog. Welcome [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the world's fastest site for building websites. May be I could learn *go* also along the way.

99% of the technical knowlegde I have has been acquired from blogs, github and stackoverflow. It's time to give back to the community. Hoping that I would be of help to someone down the road.

The hugo theme used is [Even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even). The reason to choose it is that there are no images required and ofcourse the GitHub stars. For a non visual person like me, it's a pain to choose a cover image for each posts. With this theme, there's no such tension. Using a theme means that lot of work and design decisions has already been taken and you just have to well, write and share knowledge.


## Customizing Even Theme

Since the theme of this blog is about sharing technical stuff, let me start by telling how I customize the theme.

- Change Author
- Change logoTitle under params->site info

Stay tuned for more updates in this post..Let me try publishing by turning draft to false

## Deployment

I choose [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment. It turned out to be great choice. It took less than 15 minutes to figure out how to deploy, by following the docs. The best part is that everytime I push to the git repo, the site will be automatically published. Super Awesome!!
