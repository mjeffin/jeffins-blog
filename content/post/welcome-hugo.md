This is the new home for my blog. Welcome Hugo. May be I could learn *go* also along the way.

99% of the technical knowlegde I have has been acquired from blogs, github and stackoverflow. It's time to give back to the community. Hoping that I would be of help to someone down the road.

The hugo theme used is [Even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even). The reason to choose is that there are not images in there and ofcourse the GitHub stars. For a non visual person like me, it's a pain to choose a cover image for each posts. With this theme, there's no such tension. Using a theme means that lot of work and design decisions has already been taken and you just have to well, write and share knowledge.


## Customizing Even Theme

Since the theme of this blog is about sharing technical stuff, let me start by telling how I customize the theme.

- Change Author
- Change logoTitle under params->site info

Stay tuned for more updates in this post..Let me try publishing by turning draft to falst
