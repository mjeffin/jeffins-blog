It's often said that it takes only 21 days to form a new habit. Being better organized at taking technical notes is something I 
want to achieve. So, to achieve that I'm going to write a blog post a day about either PostgreSQL or Go, 2 topics of great interest
and continuous learning for me. Let's see if I can be consistent and win the challenge!

Since there has to be post every day, it could be a short one, mostly something new I learned that day or recently which would be
of help to others and myself in the future.
