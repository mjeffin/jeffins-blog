      <description>This is the new home for my blog. Welcome Hugo. May be I could learn go also along the way.
99% of the technical knowlegde I have has been acquired from blogs, github and stackoverflow. It&amp;rsquo;s time to give back to the community. Hoping that I would be of help to someone down the road.
The hugo theme used is Even. The reason to choose is that there are not images in there and ofcourse the GitHub stars.</description>
